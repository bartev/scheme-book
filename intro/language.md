# Challenges 1 - Learning the Language

The first is learning the language itself.  Experience tells that a substantial
obstacle on the thorny path is a lack in understandable documentation and
learning resources.  There seems to be a gap between people who haven't gone
through a sufficient “initiation” and those who *have* done so - and who seem to
have lost the understanding for the beginner's needs.  Therefore this book aims
at providing a slow-paced, yet thorough introduction to Scheme's elements and
concepts.  While it is not a proper computer science book it tries to focus on
the questions that confuse aspiring LilyPond users most.
