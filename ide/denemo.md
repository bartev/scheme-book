# Denemo

[Denemo](http://denemo.org) is a program that focuses on simplifying and
speeding up the process of music entry.  It provides numerous tools to make the
user experience as smooth as possible, for example by giving instant feedback,
both visually and aurally, as you enter music.

Denemo tries to alleviate the complexity of dealing with a textual
representation of music. It does so by providing graphical tools to handle the
music directly.

When Frescobaldi intends to be a powerful editor for LilyPond's input language
Denemo intends to be a powerful notation program that internally *uses* LilyPond
for its high-quality engraving.  Denemo provides graphical and dialog based
tools to edit all aspects of the score, hiding away the complexity of the input
files when possible.
