# Frescobaldi

[Frescobaldi](http://frescobaldi.org) is a desktop application inspired by
powerful programming environments.  It aims to be a one-stop shop that
integrates all necessary tools to develop scores with LilyPond, but its main
focus remains on being a *text editor*.  While offering numerous tools that help
the user work on her scores it is always the textual *input file* that has the
full attention.

Frescobaldi fully manages the process of compiling input files and maintains a
powerful link between the music view and the input files.

Apart from displaying the compiled PDF file Frescobaldi features an SVG viewer,
a MIDI player and - as a new feature - a *manuscript* viewer allowing to display
an “engraver's copy” directly in the working environment.

Many tools are available for speeding up your work, for example the Quick Entry
palettes visible in the screenshot, music functions for pitch and rhythm
transformations, or a comprehensive score wizard.  However, all of these tools
concentrate on updating the input files, and so Frescobaldi is - while aiming at
the smoothest possible user experience - the closest thing to an “advanced text
editor”.

Frescobaldi is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and can be obtained through
its website linked at the top of this page.
