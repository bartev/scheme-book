# Other IDEs

There are other tools that can be labeled “IDE” but that didn't have the same
impact as the two programs shown before.  This may have any reasons, for example
they may target quite specific user groups.  So being listed here does
explicitly *not* mean any judgement.

### Elysium

[Elysium](http://elysium.thsoft.hu/) is an add-on for the
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) platform, a very sophisticated
general-purpose development environment.  If you don't know Eclipse yet Elysium
probably isn't for you, but if you are already an Eclipse user you may give it a
closer look.

### Emacs

(GNU) [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is arguably one of the most
powerful text editors available, trying hard to be a one-stop shop for *any*
work at the computer. Seasoned Emacs users rarely have to leave that program
which practically acts as a full-fledged desktop environment.

Emacs has a LilyPond mode.  If you don't understand that sentence you probably
don't want to bother because learning Emacs for LilyPond's editing mode is
probably not worth the effort.  Well, learning Emacs is worth the effort in
itself, but that's out of scope in this context.

### LilyBin

[LilyBin](http://lilybin.com) is an online editor that can be used to create
simple scores with LilyPond in a web browser.  The resulting scores can be
printed or saved to a Dropbox account.  While its use is mainly educational (it
provides a no-installation environment to play around with LilyPond) it can also
be a valuable tool for quickly creating LilyPond scores “on the go”.
