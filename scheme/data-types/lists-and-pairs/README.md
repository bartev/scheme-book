# Lists and Pairs

*Lists* are the fundamental entity in Scheme programming, which is pretty
natural as Scheme is a member of the
[LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) family of
languages whose name is derived from *LISt Processor*.  We have already touched
lists in the course of discussing [expressions](../expressions.html), but now
we are going to have a much closer look at them.  There are so many walls one
can run into with lists when one isn't perfectly clear about all the different
quotes and backticks, dots and parens and how to apply all those.  Therefore it
is really well-spent time and energy to get one's head properly around them.
