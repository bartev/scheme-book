# Scheme Fundamentals

This main bookpart covers the fundamentals of Scheme as used in LilyPond
documents.  However, while it *does* discuss the inclusion of Scheme code in
LilyPond documents its focus is the language aspect itself.  As a consequence
this bookpart won't discuss too many real-world uses in LilyPond, so if you are
strictly working through the book in order you might not find that part to be
real fun.  However, I think that it is crucial to have a firm understanding
about these fundamentals because it's exactly these that make learning Scheme so
(unnecessarily) confusing if not learned properly.

If it is an issue for you having to learn concepts without the opportunity to
apply them right away I have two alternative suggestions for you.  You may skip
this bookpart and head for the [Scheme in LilyPond](../lilypond/index.html) part
directly.  As the fundamental concepts won't be explained there again you will
need to jump back and forth to look up anything in the fundamentals part you
have difficulties with.  The potential gain is that you will only have to look
up what you really need, but on the other hand I think there's a pretty high
risk of neglecting the fundamental understanding that way.

As another “offer” this part of the book provides a [Music Function
Primer](music-function-primer.html), which gives you a few tools that you can
use as building blocks in LilyPond documents to try out the Scheme concepts in
actual score contexts.  The next bookpart will then provide in-depth discussion
about the interaction between LilyPond and Scheme.
