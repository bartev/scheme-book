# Assets

This page deals with managing and using assets, such as (mainly) images.

We have an `assets` directory at the repository's top-level, this is where everything should be placed, in a not-too-deep and not-too-shallow directory tree.  The root directory of the repository can be referenced as `/` in hyperlinks and image links, so an image file `assets/some-image.png` would be used like `![Screenshot](/assets/some-image.png)`.

For music examples or anything else where quality matters please use PNG or JPG images as preview and provide links to PDF files.

**TODO:** Describe syntax (link, thumbnail, caption) in more detail.

**TODO:** Create a block element for this, with image links as arguments and the
block.body as the caption.
