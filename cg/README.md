# Contributing to the "openLilyLib Book"

The "openLilyLib Book" is partly conceived as a community book, with the goal to
collect as much expertise from the community as possible.  Therefore we welcome
any contributions by adding or improving content or with improving the
infrastructure and design.  We think the infrastructure is very convenient for
contributing, but as both development and publication of the book take place on
a personal server we can't completely open up access.  However, time will
eventually tell but we may want to keep an eye on consistency, opinion and
quality of the content, so it's *not* like a Wiki that can simply be edited by
anyone.  We will try to keep a balance between editorial strictness and open
spirit, but in any case it will be good to get in touch with us before preparing
substantial contributions.

The project home is at https://git.openlilylib.org/oll/book, and to be able
to contribute you will have to have an account at the site and push access to the
project.  We don't offer the option to create forks of the repository, and you
can't create accounts on your own.  This means that if you want to contribute
you will have to ask before.  However, we will be quite generous in giving you
the appropriate privileges.  Please write to [Urs](mailto:ul@openlilylib.org)
with questions about this.

Once you are up and running you have two options: working locally or in the web
interface.  The latter is somewhat restricted in a few ways, but it has the
significant advantage that you don't need to install anything to be able to
author the book.  Read more about that on [Build System](build-system.html).
All creative work should take place in the context of working branches. Please
read also the [collaboration](collaboration.html) page to get familiar with
our branching model.

Finally you should be aware that this book is published under a Creative Commons
license (see the [license page](../license.html) for details).  By contributing
you declare your consent that your contributions are also released under that
license.
