# Understanding Scheme In LilyPond

It is well-known that LilyPond's output can be tweaked to the least detail.  But
in fact LilyPond's behaviour can be modified and extended right through to its
inner gears!  However, such power and flexibility comes at a cost, namely
learning the
[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)
programming language and its integration with LilyPond.

In a way, extending Lilypond with Scheme is like open heart surgery, and it is
definitely not necessary to be able to *program* in order to *use* LilyPond for
engraving scores.  But even without any ambitions to “program LilyPond” it is
always a good idea to familiarize oneself with some characteristics of Scheme
because one will get in touch with it at every level.

Unfortunately the [official
documentation](http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/extending/index.html)
is not exactly helpful in smoothly introducing beginners to the world of Scheme.
And particularly the integration of Scheme in LilyPond can be a real challenge
to get comfortable with.  Therefore this book provides a slow-paced and thorough
introduction to the basics of Scheme, with specific concern for usage in
LilyPond.  It is not a formal computer science textbook but rather tries to
eliminate the typical obstacles that LilyPond users face when trying to approach
Scheme.  The goal of the book is giving a firm understanding and fundamental
knowledge of Scheme and its integration in LilyPond, not a comprehensive
coverage.  Having studied the following chapters can't replace further
individual learning, but should at least give the reader a robust foundation for
that task.

This book is part of [The Plain Text And Music
Book](https://textbook.openlilylib.org).
