# Extending LilyPond

It is well-known that LilyPond's output can be tweaked to the least detail.  But
in fact LilyPond's behaviour can be modified and extended right through to its
inner gears!  However, such power and flexibility comes at a cost, namely
learning the
[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29)
programming language and its integration with LilyPond.  

In a way, extending Lilypond with Scheme is like open heart surgery, and it is
definitely not necessary to be able to *program* in order to *use* LilyPond for
engraving scores.  But at the same time the user will get in touch with the
basic language constructs at every level of work, so it is always a good idea to
familiarize oneself with some characteristics of Scheme.

Unfortunately the [official
documentation](http://www.lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/extending/index.html)
is not exactly helpful in smoothly introducing beginners to the world of Scheme.
And particularly the integration of Scheme in LilyPond can be a real challenge
to get comfortable with.  Therefore this part of the book provides a slow-paced
and thorough introduction to the basics of Scheme, aiming at giving the reader a
firm understanding and fundamental knowledge.  Having studied the following
chapters should give the reader a robust foundation for further learning.
