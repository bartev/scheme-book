# GNU LilyPond

[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) is a *score writer* or *music typesetting
system*, built on the paradigm of compiling input files.  Its foremost virtues
are the engraving quality, flexibility and reliability, as well as anything that
is related to the text based approach, which has already been discussed in the
[bookpart above](toolchain/README.md).  However, this versatility comes at a
prize - actually the usual one for professional tools: it is pretty complex.

LilyPond provides excellent documentation, but beyond the [Learning
Manual](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/learning/index.html) which
gives a rather slow-paced practical introduction it necessarily has to be a
pretty concise *reference*.  And this reference is not always appropriate for
learning the underlying concepts.  This can be seen in two issues:

* Recurring questions on the
  [lilypond-user](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/lilypond-user) mailing
  list.  
  These show that there are quite basic misconceptions that occur regularly.
*  There seems to be a rather large community of advanced users who
  don't dare or don't manage to take a certain step in mastering LilyPond
  and especially its potentials of programmatic extending.

The *openLilyLib Tutorials*, initially hosted on
[openlilylib.org](http://openlilylib.org/tutorials) and now at home at [Scores
of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org/category/tutorials) are intended to help out
with this situation.  On the one hand they provide solutions and best practices
to common issues, on the other hand they provide slow-paced and in-depth
introductions to the more advanced topics.

This part of the book provides a single place to combine these resources.  While
not directly conceived as a coherent text the idea is to encourage authors to
create new content with the perspective of such future coherence.
