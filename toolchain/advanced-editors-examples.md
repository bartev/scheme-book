# Some Advanced Editors

The previous sections presented a few exemplary techniques commonly found in
advanced programmer's editors.  They are not intended as a comprehensive
introduction to the topic but merely to give you a first impression what
“advanced text editing” can be about.

The following list shows a non-comprehensive selection of advanced text editors
that are known or said to support LilyPond to some extent. As said earlier you
will probably not (initially) use any of them for working with LilyPond if you
are completely new to plain text work.  Instead you will work with an IDE and
just know that at its core is an “advanced text editor”.  Therefore we won't
give any further directions how to get any of these to work with LilyPond.
However, you may want to have a look at their websites to get a better idea of
how plain text editors may look, what kind of features are usual and how their
authors talk about them.
