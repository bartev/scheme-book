# “Running” LilyPond

The second step in the LilyPond toolchain is having LilyPond compile the
prepared input files.  Due to LilyPond's nature as a “batch program” this is
achieved by invoking the program in a terminal, passing it the file(s) to be
processed and optionally a number of arguments.  However, this is not the way we
suggest for new users.  Instead (as mentioned repeatedly) you will get one of
the IDEs and have that handle the details for you.

There are many interesting reasons for directly using LilyPond through the
command line, and these reasons are also part of the story why plain text based
tools are inherently more powerful than GUI applications.  But all of them are
beyond the scope of what you should bother with *now*.  If you are interested
you may read more about the process in LilyPond's [Usage
Manual](http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/usage/index.html).
