# Console Output

As any other batch program running in a terminal LilyPond reports about state, success and failure through *console output* in that terminal.  If you have never worked “on the command line” this may be somewhat intimidating in the beginning but it is a good idea to get familiar with this as soon as possible.  IDEs typically hide away the task of running LilyPond but they will nevertheless provide a way to inspect the console output.

```
GNU LilyPond 2.19.30
Processing `la-chute-d-icare-69.ly'
Parsing...
Interpreting music...
Preprocessing graphical objects...
Finding the ideal number of pages...
Fitting music on 1 page...
Drawing systems...
Layout output to `/tmp/lilypond-9tKD1w'...
Converting to `la-chute-d-icare-69.pdf'...
Deleting `/tmp/lilypond-9tKD1w'...
Success: compilation successfully completed
```

This is the result of a typical LilyPond session running without any issues (the lines of that log will appear consecutively during the compilation process).  First it reports its own version and the file it is going to compile, then the lines with the trailing dots report on the processing progress.

If there should be any problems with your input file or with the resulting score LilyPond will try to do its best to indicate the source of the problems.  And this is meant quite literally: error messages and warnings usually contain links to the actual line in the input file that caused the issue, lending you a helping hend for fixing the issue yourself.
