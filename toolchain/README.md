# “Where Is My Window?”

There's a classic question often asked by people trying to use LilyPond for the
first time:

> I have successfully downloaded and installed LilyPond. But when I double-click
on the desktop icon, no program window appears. Instead I just see a small text editor.  What am I doing wrong?

This user can be considered lucky because she has actually *asked* that question
instead of immediately giving up and uninstalling the seemingly non-functional
program. The problem is that she's doing *everything* wrong - because she
doesn't know what *kind* of software LilyPond is and how to handle that species.

On LilyPond's [website](http://lilypond.org) you can learn that

> LilyPond processes text input,

that we

> write music as text,

and that there are tools available for

> easier editing.

But admittedly all this doesn't really help you overcoming the initial confusion
of not even getting that application window to show up.  In order to get you up
and running the following chapters will provide a gentle introduction to the
concepts and the components of a *modular toolchain*.  But as said you are always
free to jump right into the [Hello World](../hello-world.html) walk-through.
