# Text Editors

Of course the text files fed into LilyPond have to be prepared with *something*.
Therefore a *text editor* is the first thing to have in order to “work with
LilyPond”.  But you are not at all tied to any specific software.  Quite the
contrary, the input files can be edited with virtually *any* tool that is
capable of working with text files.  There are several *types* of tools
available for that task:

* Basic text editors
* Advanced (programmer's) text editors
* Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
* *(Programming languages, just mentioned for completeness)*

The following pages will explain the characteristics of basic and advanced text
editors.  IDEs will be covered later but they typically *contain* an advanced
text editor so you should get familiar with that aspect even when you intend to
follow our advice and start working with an IDE.  The ability to use programming
languages to generate or (pre-)process LilyPond input has powerful implications
for LilyPond's *extensibility* but this aspect is clearly out of scope for the
current introduction.
