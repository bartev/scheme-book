# Basic Text Editors

LilyPond's input is defined in plain text files and can therefore be edited in
basic text editors of any kind, such as e.g. *Notepad* on Windows (it seems only
Windows actually ships with an editor that is *that* basic ...).

The lack of any useful editing features seems to make this kind of tool somewhat
pointless but it's good to know they are there.  The nice thing about plain text
editors is that they are ubiquitously available and allow you to edit your
LilyPond files *anywhere*:  You can scribble LilyPond sketches with your web
mailer or the your smartphone's note app.  It's even possible to pass along a
tune in an SMS! As an example you may have a look at this
[Screenshot](assets/toolchain/ly-in-trello-android.png) of a comment containing
some LilyPond music which is entered in the [Trello](https://trello.com) list
app on Android.  Later when you'll learn about collaborative workflows you will
see that it's even possible to directly edit your project files in a web
interface.

However, LilyPond input is not just written in basic plain text but in an
advanced plain text *format*, or rather an *input language*, often also referred
to as *source code*.  And editing documents in such advanced “languages” greatly
benefits from assistance through advanced editing tools, as you will see in the
next section.
