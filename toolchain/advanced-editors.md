# Advanced Text Editors

Rather than using basic text editors as described in the previous section most
users edit their LilyPond files with *advanced text editors*.  These can be
standalone applications - often referred to as “programmers' editors” or [Source
Code Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor) - or they are
the editing component inside an IDE.  This chapter covers some concepts of both
standalone and integrated editors so you will want to read it regardless of what
you are eventually going to use.  This will also give you a better idea about how
working with plain text file formats actually “feels like”.


### “Input Language”

We have said that LilyPond “compiles” text files, and this is quite similar to
how programming works in general.  Consequently the *format* that is used to
write LilyPond input is called its *input language* and the content of the input
files is often referred to as *source code*.  While it isn't really a
*programming* language it shares many characteristics with these, and it can
make use of the same editing features commonly found in the software developer's
toolbox.

Advanced text editors usually provide one or more of the following features,
some of  which will be introduced in the following sections:

* Syntax highlighting
* Indentation
* Bracket matching
* Code folding
* Syntax checking
* Code completion
